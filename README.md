# CA_Workflow2
Course Assignment in WorkFlow2. "For this practical exercise you will be required to automate the semester project that you created for your HTML and CSS course. I would advise that you use either gulp or grunt for the automation process. However, if you want to use WebPack you may. You may use Sass or Less - that is up to you."
